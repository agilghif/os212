<h3 style="color: #FFC300;"> About Me </h3>
Hello All! I'm **Agil** and I'm a Computer Science student from Universitas Indonesia! I come from Bukittinggi, West Sumatra and yes, I'm "Urang awak :)"! I like math and physics-related things (including computer science of course :)!) and I hope that I can do things computer science that are related to the latter :). Visit my Github for further information about me and my project.
